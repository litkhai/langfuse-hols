# AGENTS.md

Instructions for coding agents working in this repository.

This repository was split out of [litkhai/clickhouse-hols](https://github.com/litkhai/clickhouse-hols). Its
[AGENTS.md](https://github.com/litkhai/clickhouse-hols/blob/main/AGENTS.md) still applies here —
bilingual READMEs (English first, `## English` / `## 한국어`), no links to labs
that do not exist yet, and the **Verification claims** rule: only write
*"Verified on …"* when the scripts actually ran end to end against that version.

Differences from the core repository:

- No Pages site and no `site` CI job (decision D7). The root README tables are
  documentation only, not a site index.
- Enable the guard once per clone: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.

## Rules for this repository

- `labs/langfuse-eval` imports the trace generator from `labs/langfuse-ee` and shares its
  compose stack. They are siblings on purpose — never move one without the other.
- Verification lines name Langfuse, the Python SDK and ClickHouse versions
  (e.g. *Langfuse v3.197.1 / SDK 3.7.0 / CH 25.11*).
- `labs/langfuse-ee/08-generate-pii-traces.py` fabricates PII on purpose and is allowlisted
  in `.gitleaks.toml`. Do not widen that allowlist to a directory.

## Where things came from

Paths were renamed by `git filter-repo`, so `git log --follow` works across the
split. The original locations:

| In clickhouse-hols | Here |
|---|---|
| `usecase/langfuse-ee/` | `labs/langfuse-ee/` |
| `usecase/langfuse-eval/` | `labs/langfuse-eval/` |

## Tracking work

Planned work, re-verification and follow-ups are **GitHub issues**; every change
lands through a **pull request** that references its issue (`Closes #N`).
`STATUS.md` is a snapshot of the current state and links to the open issues
instead of keeping its own to-do list. When you find something to do that you
are not doing now, open an issue rather than writing it into a README or
`STATUS.md`. Labels: `re-verify` (changed but not re-run), `enhancement`,
`docs`, `ops`, `security`.

한국어: 해야 할 일은 GitHub 이슈로, 변경은 이슈를 참조하는 PR로 관리합니다. `STATUS.md`는 열린 이슈를 링크합니다.

## Model roles

Work in this repository is split across Claude models:

| Role | Model | Does |
|------|-------|------|
| Lead | **Opus** | Plans and designs the work, writes and updates documentation (READMEs, `AGENTS.md`, `STATUS.md`, issues, PR descriptions), splits the work into tasks and reviews what comes back |
| Implementer | **Sonnet** | Writes the code, scripts and SQL for a task the lead hands over, runs the checks, opens the PR |
| Status checker | **Haiku** | Read-only checks: CI and `smoke` results, open issues and PRs, link and syntax checks, what changed since the last look |

The lead gives the implementer one issue at a time with the design and the files
to touch; the implementer does not change the design or the docs' claims on its
own. Verification claims still follow the rule above: only a real end-to-end run
updates them, whichever model ran it.

한국어: Opus는 리드(설계·문서·리뷰), Sonnet은 구현(코드·PR), Haiku는 현황 체크(읽기 전용)를 맡습니다.
